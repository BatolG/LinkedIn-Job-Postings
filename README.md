# LinkedIn Job Postings Data Visualization

## About the Data
Every day, LinkedIn serves as a go-to platform for thousands of companies and individuals in their search for talent. This dataset encompasses a nearly comprehensive record of 33,000+ job postings listed over two days, separated by several months. Each posting provides 27 valuable attributes, such as the job title, description, salary, location, application URL, and work types (remote, contract, etc.). Additionally, separate files are available for the associated benefits, skills, and industries related to each posting. Moreover, most jobs are linked to respective companies, which are detailed in another CSV file containing attributes like company description, headquarters location, number of employees, and follower count.

With an abundance of data points, this dataset offers immense potential for exploration. Possibilities include analyzing the highest compensated titles, companies, and locations, predicting salaries and benefits through NLP techniques, and examining how industries and companies differ in terms of internship offerings and benefits. Future updates will enable further exploration of time-based trends, such as company growth, the prevalence of remote jobs, and the changing demand for specific job titles over time.
